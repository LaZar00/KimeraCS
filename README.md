# KimeraCS
This is the C# version of the original and amazing utility from Borde called Kimera (done in Visual Basic 6 and OpenGL) useful for modding models of Final Fantasy VII. I have in my repository his original tool and you can find it also at:
https://github.com/tsunamods-codes/kimera

This tool has been developed in C#, and the tool needs at least .NET Framework 4.7.2 runtime. The OpenGL calls are native methods, so, there is no need of other framework or library to run it.

This version of Kimera has the same features as the Borde's one plus some new (look the readme.txt at \doc folder) and tried to be implemented for modern languages.

You can report any issue you find if you wish and I will try to solve. I'm not open to new feature requests or pull requests tough.

Enjoy this tool.
